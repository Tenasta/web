## What I Do

**Drop-in technical leadership** for startups that need a senior technical leader without a full-time hire:

- 🔍 **Readiness Audits** – Know where you stand before raising, launching, or hiring
- 🚀 **Embedded Sprints** – Hands-on problem solving when you need to ship now
- 🎯 **Launch Support** – Ship with confidence when it matters most

## Experience

20+ years shipping products across seed through growth stages. Former CTO, founding engineer, and technical leader who's learned what works (and what doesn't) the hard way.

Built teams. Scaled systems. Shipped under pressure. Now helping founders navigate the same challenges.
